# Development

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 x64
- .NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack or Windows compiler path available
- Windows PowerShell 5.1
- Optional: PowerShell 7.x
- OpenSSH client
- curl.exe

## Build

```powershell
.\scripts\Build-ProGo.ps1
```

## Test

```powershell
.\scripts\Test-ProGo.ps1
.\scripts\Test-HomeVpnRelay.ps1
python .\scripts\check_public_content.py --release .\release
```

The relay tests and public-content check require Python 3.12 in CI. The content
check covers source files and the compiled release, including UTF-16 strings in
the executable. Use reserved documentation addresses and generic paths in public
examples; manual review is still required for names, hostnames, and context.

`Test-ProGo.ps1` also runs `tests/SocksRecoveryTests.cs` on .NET Framework.
The harness exercises the actual process manager using disposable loopback-only
child processes and a test clock, including crashes, backoff, manual stop,
opt-out, port conflicts, and profile fallback. It does not use real SSH servers.

## Install locally

```powershell
.\scripts\Install-ProGo.ps1
```

## Uninstall locally

```powershell
.\scripts\Uninstall-ProGo.ps1
```

## Repository hygiene

Never commit:

- `vault*.json`
- `vault*.enc*`
- `.env`, `.env.*`
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.pfx`, `*.p12`
- logs
- credentials
- real host/IP/login/token/password values in examples

## Change control

Separate approval is required for changes to:

- vault file format;
- encryption algorithm;
- KDF;
- PIN policy;
- decoy/duress semantics;
- license/commercial permissions;
- telemetry;
- auto-update;
- backend/cloud sync.

## Home VPN validation

`Test-HomeVpnRelay.ps1` creates temporary certificates and keys under `build`,
checks token rejection, profile identity/routing, DPAPI and wizard navigation,
and then runs the socket relay integration suite. It requires OpenSSH and OpenSSL
(Git for Windows supplies OpenSSL in CI). Generated credentials never enter the package.

`tests/home_vpn_provision_smoke.py` is restricted to a disposable Ubuntu GitHub
Actions runner. It installs real strongSwan/OpenSSH, issues independent invites,
checks the allowed relay port and denied arbitrary ports, and verifies revocation.
Never run this provisioning test on an existing personal or production server.
