# Development

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 x64
- .NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack or Windows compiler path available
- Windows PowerShell 5.1
- Optional: PowerShell 7.x
- OpenSSH client
- curl.exe

## Build

```powershell
.\scripts\Build-ProGo.ps1
```

## Test

```powershell
.\scripts\Test-ProGo.ps1
.\scripts\Test-HomeVpnRelay.ps1
python .\scripts\check_public_content.py --release .\release
```

The relay tests and public-content check require Python 3.12 in CI. The content
check covers source files and the compiled release, including UTF-16 strings in
the executable. Use reserved documentation addresses and generic paths in public
examples; manual review is still required for names, hostnames, and context.

`Test-ProGo.ps1` also runs `tests/SocksRecoveryTests.cs` on .NET Framework.
The harness exercises the actual process manager using disposable loopback-only
child processes and a test clock, including crashes, backoff, manual stop,
opt-out, port conflicts, and profile fallback. It does not use real SSH servers.

## Install locally

```powershell
.\scripts\Install-ProGo.ps1
```

## Uninstall locally

```powershell
.\scripts\Uninstall-ProGo.ps1
```

## Repository hygiene

Never commit:

- `vault*.json`
- `vault*.enc*`
- `.env`, `.env.*`
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.pfx`, `*.p12`
- logs
- credentials
- real host/IP/login/token/password values in examples

## Change control

Separate approval is required for changes to:

- vault file format;
- encryption algorithm;
- KDF;
- PIN policy;
- decoy/duress semantics;
- license/commercial permissions;
- telemetry;
- auto-update;
- backend/cloud sync.

## Home VPN validation

`Test-HomeVpnRelay.ps1` creates temporary certificates and keys under `build`,
checks token rejection, profile identity/routing, DPAPI and wizard navigation,
and then runs the socket relay integration suite. It requires OpenSSH and OpenSSL
(Git for Windows supplies OpenSSL in CI). Generated credentials never enter the package.

`tests/home_vpn_provision_smoke.py` is restricted to a disposable Ubuntu GitHub
Actions runner. It installs real strongSwan/OpenSSH, issues independent invites,
checks the allowed relay port and denied arbitrary ports, and verifies revocation.
Never run this provisioning test on an existing personal or production server.

## Desktop 0.2 validation

`Test-ProGo.ps1` also runs `DesktopTests.cs` for preference migration, all combinations
of independent automatic actions, manual override, scoped Codex launch, HTTP/CONNECT
round trips through a loopback SOCKS fixture, native form screenshots and 150% scaling.
`UpdatePackageTests.ps1` loads only updater function definitions in a disposable test
scope and rejects corrupt digests, missing metadata, unexpected hosts and archive
traversal. Runtime code never evaluates downloaded scripts. Windows screenshots
are CI artifacts. They contain only synthetic connection settings and empty vaults.

The executable is unsigned. Do not claim antivirus clearance based on CI success;
record a vendor result separately. Do not introduce exclusions, obfuscation or
antivirus-disabling code. A future Authenticode rollout needs a real publisher
certificate and protected signing credentials; never commit such credentials.

### Audit stage F02

Desktop regressions also exercise automatic setup through a real occupied
loopback proxy port and a simulated configuration-write failure, then clear both
faults and verify successful application without restarting ProGo. The injected
clock checks delayed/bounded retries, permanent errors, manual cancellation,
explicit re-arming and reentrancy without sleeping or using a real VPS. Native
screenshots include the paused automatic-setup status and corrective guidance.
The other audit findings remain tracked separately in `AUDIT_PROGRESS.md`.
